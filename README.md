# Experian-Case-study--Model-for-calculating-gross-income-from-net-income-and-tax-slab
The model predicts gross value incomes from net income and tax slabs which was used by Experian for credit assessment.

Gross annual income values are vital to credit assessment service providers in the UK,
including Experian. This data is used as the metric through which the creditworthiness of
individuals is evaluated prior to mortgage application approvals/denials. However, accessing
the gross annual income data is not feasible in reality. Thus, the report introduces a
mathematical algorithm developed using systematic programming techniques that accurately
estimates the gross annual income from net monthly income. The developed solution caters
for individuals in both Scotland and other regions in the UK and uses the appropriate national
insurance and income tax brackets. The report presents the methodology in detail, discusses
the solutionâ€™s strengths and limitations, and advocates for a comprehensive approach to
estimating the gross annual income.
